        I like the Vande Matram song because it was a tribute to the motherland and also the featured songs to mark the
        three colours of the Indian flag.This beautiful song was sung by A.R.Rahman.The video of this song is very
        beautiful to visualise.

    <h1>Praneeth Shanigaram</h1>
    <p>
        My favourite movie is KGF(Kolar Gold Fileds).It was directed by Prashanth Neel.
        Yash is the hero of this movie.Yash,named Rocky in the film,seeks power and the wealth in order to fulfil the
        promise that he had given to his mother who was going to die.

    <h1>Code Snippet</h1>
    <p> The event module includes an EventEmitter class that can be used to raise and handle custom events.</p>
    <pre>
            const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

            function c1() {
	            console.log('an event occurred!');
            }

            function c2() {
	            console.log('yet another event occurred!');
            }

            myEmitter.on('eventOne', c1); // Register for eventOne
            myEmitter.on('eventOne', c2); // Register for eventOne
