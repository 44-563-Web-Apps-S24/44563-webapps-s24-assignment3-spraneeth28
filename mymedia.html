            I like the Vande Matram song because it was a tribute to the motherland and also the featured songs to mark the three colours of the Indian flag.This beautiful song was sung by A.R.Rahman.The video of this song is very beautiful to visualise.

        <h1>Praneeth Shanigaram</h1>

            My favourite movie is KGF(Kolar Gold Fileds).It was directed by Prashanth Neel.
            Yash is the hero of this movie.Yash,named Rocky in the film,seeks power and the wealth in order to fulfil the promise that he had given to his mother who was going to die.
